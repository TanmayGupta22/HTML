                Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their 
                creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what 
                topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the 
                writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. 
                The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build 
                upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short 
                story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the 
                ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is 
                undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the 
                paragraph into their writing
